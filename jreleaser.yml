  longDescription: >
    Photos Renamer is a Java-based desktop application that will allow you to visually
    sort your photos. You can select one or many photos, and move them up or down as a
    group using keyboard shortcut keys. There are several automatic sort options too,
    such as by filename or by the date in the EXIF data in the image. After you are done
    sorting, you can rename all of the photos with a prefix, and Photos Renamer will
    number them.
