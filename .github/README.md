# Photos Renamer

Photos Renamer is a lightweight Java UI that displays thumbnails of the images in a folder. You can select one or more images, and move them up or down in the list. When you are done, you can rename them, using a prefix for the filename. There are keyboard shortcuts for all actions.

Notes:
- Java 8 is required to run
- Build using Gradle, which will download dependencies
- If you use Eclipse, use the Gradle UI
